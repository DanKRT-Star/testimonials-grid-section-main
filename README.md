## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned how to use CSS Grid and Flexbox together to create responsive layouts. I practiced using custom properties for colors and improved my understanding of mobile-first design. I also learned how to center content both vertically and horizontally using flexbox, and how to use grid-template-areas for complex desktop layouts.

Example CSS:

```css
main {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
}

.blogs-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-areas: 
        "blog1 blog1 blog2 blog5"
        "blog3 blog4 blog4 blog5";
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus more on accessibility and semantic HTML. I also plan to explore more advanced CSS techniques and animations to enhance user experience.
